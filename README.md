# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
After all of our hard work in the initial analyis of school data, we were made aware that academic dishonesty had been performed while reporting the reading and math scores of Thomas High School's ninth grade class.  In order to rectify the situation and report the most accurate analysis possible, we took the ninth graders of Thomas High School out of our evaluation of school performance by replacing their scores with null values.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
  - Surprisingly, the district statistics seem unchanged.

    It is only after removing the formatting to our table when we see any alteration in the numbers.

  This is because at a district level, the number of one class of students at one high school just isn't enough to change the calulations very much.
